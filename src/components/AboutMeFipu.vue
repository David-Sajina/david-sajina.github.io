				In my extensive journey of exploration and application, I've cultivated
				a diverse portfolio of projects that underscore my dedication to
				innovative problem-solving. Among my notable achievements is the foray
				into Machine Learning, where I harnessed the capabilities of OpenBCI to
				decipher brainwave signals, specifically focusing on discerning
				cognitive patterns associated with geometric objects. My portfolio
				extends to encompass the creation of various websites and mobile
				applications.
